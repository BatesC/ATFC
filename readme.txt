I NEED TO MAKE A VIDEO TO SHOW HOW TO DO THIS WHEN I FINISH THE GAME (earlier will show them where the game is and they will get an unfinished version)

# Instructions
1) Download the zip file at the bottom right of the file page (https://github.com/BatesC/ATFC)
2) Extract the game folder into a folder that's easily accessible (C:\ATFC rather than C:\Program Files x86\MemeFolder1\Pepe\Rare\ATFC)
3) Open the start menu and type in "cmd" (no quotes) then press enter
4) Find your way to the game folder in the command prompt then type python ATFC.py
5) Play the game!
